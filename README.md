In this assignment, the webpage background image is changed to another earth image. 
Table included all columns as required.
The search table will show the filter search results and the form field will be reset to the original status when the Filter Table button is clicked.
The code to prevent the page from reloading using D3 is included.
I have also completed three (3) sessions:
1. UFO-level-1 
    > A filter for the date is added for this table as according to the requirement.
    > "No search results for xxxxxxxx" will be appeared if the search column of the dataset does not contain the date or information entered into the filter form.
    > To see the whole dataset, user can click the Filter Table with the empty cell. This note is also added under the Form for user's reference.

2. UFO-level-2
    > Code is able to handle 5 total filters at once with the multi-filtered data rendered back to the table. This includes scenarios of 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or all 5 of the 5 filters with input values in a filter event.
    > The five filters include the following as required:
        a) date
        b) city
        c) state
        d) country
        e) shape
    > "Your search returned no results" will be appeared if the search column of the dataset does not contain the input value.
    > To see the whole dataset, user can click the Filter Table with the empty cells. This note is also added below the "Enter a shape" Form for user's reference.

3. UFO-level-2a
    > User can select a filter from a total of 5 filters available to do the filter search. 
    > Code is able to handle 1 of the 5 filters the user selected. I tried on this before the UFO-level-2. Thus, I have this additional session.
    > A Form is included in every dropdown of the 5 filters. 
    > The five filters include the following as required:
        a) date
        b) city
        c) state
        d) country
        e) shape
    > "Your search returned no results" will be appeared if the search column of the dataset does not contain the input value.
    > To see the whole dataset, user can click the Filter Table with the empty cells. This note is also added below the "Enter a shape" Form for user's reference.
